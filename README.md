## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time object detection** using YOLOv8. 🕵️‍♂️
- **Voice command interaction** for seamless user experience. 🗣️
- **Contextual feedback** about detected objects and their distances. 📏
- **Easy-to-use interface** with text-to-speech (TTS) integration. 🔊

## 📄 Research Paper
This project is based on our research paper titled **"Enhancing Accessibility for the Visually Impaired through Text Voice-Activated Images"**, which was presented at [Your Conference Name].

📌 You can read the full paper here: [Assistive_Tech_Research_Paper.pdf](./Assistive_Tech_Research_Paper.pdf)

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the program:

bash
Copy
python assistive_tech.py
Speak commands like:

"What is in front of me?" 🎤

"Describe the scene." 🖼️

📋 Requirements
Python 3.x 🐍

A working microphone 🎤

A webcam 📷

🛠️ Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/hemanth816/Assistive_tech.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy
cd Assistive_tech
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
🧠 How It Works
The system captures real-time video from the webcam. 📹

It uses YOLOv8 to detect objects in the video feed. 🕵️‍♂️

The detected objects are described using text-to-speech (TTS). 🔊

Users can interact with the system using voice commands. 🗣️
